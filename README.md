Cant:

# Set up
Make sure your TV is logged into your smart things account.

Obtain an API key from https://account.smartthings.com/tokens

Go [here](https://graph-eu01-euwest1.api.smartthings.com/device/list) for your device id for each device. Click on the name of your TV and the device id will be in the URL

> https://graph-eu01-euwest1.api.smartthings.com/device/show/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXX

In your configuration.yaml add:

```
media_player:
  - platform: smartthingstv
    name: My TV name
    api_key: "YOUR API KEY"
    device_id: "YOUR DEVICE ID"
    mac: "YOUR MAC ADDRESS"
```
